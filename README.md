## Classification of dysphonic Voice Pattern of Patients in Parkinson's Disease 

This project aims to train a model that clasiffies voices of people with parkinson's disorder from those without parkinson's disorder. 
An analysis of quantified voice patterns patterns in people phonation disorders related to Parkinson's.

## Description 

This repository contains the code to analyze and make a model thal classifies voices of people with Parkinson's Disorder from those without.

## Data

The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.
The dataset can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons

## Data description

The different columns of the table are described in the documentation directory https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons
